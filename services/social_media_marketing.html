      Facebook Advertising Services
    </h1>
    
    <h2>
      <strong>Facebook advertising that gets results.</strong>
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Facebook advertising offers some of the most accurate demographic and interest targeting for finding new customers. By leveraging Facebook’s powerful ad platform, we make sure people who need your products or services see your business as a solution for those needs.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Retargeting customers.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Retargeting works when your potential customer visits your website and then leaves. Later, we will show them your ads on Facebook. These ads will show them relevant information (or maybe a special offer) that will get them to want to come back to your site. This makes your marketing campaigns have even more of an impact with precision targeting. We manage thousands of Facebook ads for successful businesses and are known for getting results.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There is a lot of complexity to making Facebook and Instagram work for your business and you know how overwhelming it can be. This is where we come in – we’ll do the heavy lifting. Our agency pricing allows us to work for you at a fraction of what a full-time employee would cost to manage your Facebook ads.
    </p>

        <h2>
          Targeting
        </h2>
        <p>
          We will take the time to learn who your ideal customer is so we have detailed customer profiles to target for you on Facebook. This information is used as a foundation for targeting when we set up your FB ads.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Geo-Social Campaigns for Local Marketing
        </h2>
        <p>
          Run locally targeted ad campaigns that are only visible to people within a specific radius of your business. With local marketing ads, we can target and communicate with anyone near your business and provide them with an incentive to visit your location in real-time.

          Ad Design
